# Changelog

All notable changes to VibeGuard are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-30

### Added
- SARIF 2.1.0 output is now validated against the official SARIF JSON schema
  (`tests/test_sarif.py`; schema vendored in `tests/sarif-2.1.0.schema.json`),
  so `vibeguard scan --sarif` uploads cleanly to GitHub code scanning.
- 8 new detection rules (40 total): GitHub server-to-server tokens (`ghs_`),
  Stripe test keys (`sk_test_`, medium severity since they only touch test
  data), Telegram bot tokens, Shopify admin API tokens (`shpat_`), Sentry
  auth tokens (`sntrys_`), npm registry auth tokens (`_authToken=` in `.npmrc`),
  PuTTY private key files, Linear API keys (`lin_api_`).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added
- Baseline support: `vibeguard scan --update-baseline [PATH]` records current
  findings; `vibeguard scan --baseline PATH` (or `baseline = "..."` in
  `.vibeguard.toml`) suppresses known findings so CI only fails on new
  secrets. Fingerprints exclude line numbers, so a known secret that moves
  within a file stays suppressed.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- `__version__` string now matches the package version.
- GitHub Action renamed to "VibeGuard Secret Scanner" for Marketplace
  uniqueness.

### Added
- PyPI version badge in the README.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-21

### Added
- Terminal demo GIF (`docs/demo.gif`) showing VibeGuard catching a hardcoded
  Stripe key, now embedded in the README.

### Fixed
- `fail-on` input of the GitHub Action was defined but silently ignored;
  it now forwards to the scan. New `--fail-on {high,medium}` CLI flag
  overrides the `fail_on` config value.

### Changed
- PyPI distribution renamed to `vibeguard-secrets` (`pip install
  vibeguard-secrets`); the `vibeguard` name was already taken. The `vibeguard`
  command and Python package name are unchanged.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-21

First public release.

### Added
- Secret scanner with 32 detection rules: AWS (access key, secret key,
  session token), Azure storage keys, GCP service-account hints, Stripe
  (live + restricted), Twilio, SendGrid, Mailgun, GitHub tokens (classic,
  fine-grained, OAuth, app), GitLab PATs, npm + PyPI tokens, Heroku,
  DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Slack tokens + webhooks, Discord bot tokens +
  webhooks, OpenAI (API, project, service-account), Anthropic, Hugging Face,
  Google API keys, private key blocks, database connection strings, plus
  generic secret-assignment and high-entropy heuristics.
- `vibeguard scan` with `--staged` (default), `--all`, and `--base <ref>`
  targets; path limiting; JSON and SARIF 2.1.0 output formats.
- Optional LLM review of diffs via any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (`VIBEGUARD_API_KEY`), flagging injection flaws, auth bypass, and other
  logic-level issues regexes can't see.
- Pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`) and GitHub Action (`action.yml`)
  with an example PR workflow.
- `.vibeguard.toml` configuration: `fail_on` severity threshold, `allowlist`
  globs, LLM settings. `vibeguard init` writes a starter config.
- CI workflow: pytest on Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12, plus a dogfood step
  that scans the VibeGuard repo itself.

### Notes
- Python 3.10 installs the tiny `tomli` backport (stdlib `tomllib` on 3.11+).
  The scanner itself is stdlib-only.
